Steps:
1. Place your statically compiled binary in this folder
2. Edit code in two places in main.go, as described in the file
3. run build.sh, push the image manually if network fails
4. Pull the image in all the nodes, if network failed in previous step
5. If you want to remove the function, also clean the relevant docker-compose.yml and prometheus.yml

**DONT TOUCH THE NAME OF readme, Dockerfile.scratch, build.sh, main.go**
